      <h1>Expectution - Special Tuition Services</h1>
      <p>Tuition Makes Singapore Students The Best In The World</p>
      <p>Students from Singapore have again ranked first in Science and Math in an international evaluation of proficiency conducted by the International Mathematics and Science Study.</p>
      <p>Tuition is a tradition in Singapore that has ancient roots. Many of the brightest and best teachers leave the academic world to become tutors and owners of their own tuition centres. The small teacher to student ratio and the opportunity to make a more productive change in a student’s life is one of the major reasons why the best teachers opt for tutoring.</p>
      <p>Parents realise that subjects such as Math, Sciences, Economics, and English are necessary for developing their children’s potential completely. Better jobs and higher incomes come from better educational performances.</p>
      <p>Our tuition centre is designed to guide each student according to his/her skills level and needs. Courses that complement the child’s present class work can be selected. Preparation for future endeavour to give the child a head start in life, is also a much sought-after advantage.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Students are Special</h2>
      <p>Our tuition is not only about academic results, but we also believe in true learning and teacher mentoring. A child who understands how and why he learns has an advantage. He who realises what has been holding them back from achieving their full potential is our finest achievement.</p>
      <p>Tuition is what we do. We change lives in the process.</p>
